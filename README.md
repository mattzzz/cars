## Cars is a simple webapp to predict and classify a photo of a single seater racing car

Will classify either:

* Formula 1
* Formula e
* Indycar

The CNN is a resnet34. The classifications were chosen as they are very similar in appearance.

The webapp is built with Flask.

The deep learning library uses fast.ai which is built around PyTorch.
